<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="black"><blockquote> <b><font face size="5"> Linus Benedict Torvalds </font></b> (b.28 Dec 1969) is Finnish-American software engineer. As understood from his name, he is the inventor of Linux kernel. Contrary to popular belief Linux is not an operating system. It is an operating system kernel, which means all Linux based systems uses that kernel. Developers around the world can be change or add features. Linux grew increasingly so Linus publish 0.12 with GPL. General Public License is supporting the freedom. It means any manufacturers canâ€™t use backdoor or canâ€™t hide source codes. On the other hand, he is creator of git. Git is a distributed version control program. Also he has got a lot of prize. Some of them: in 2012 Millennium Technology Prize, in 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award. And he has write a book named â€˜â€™Just for Fun â€˜â€™ <a href=" http://www.amazon.com/Just-Fun-Story-Accidental-Revolutionary/dp/0066620732">[1]</a> . Itâ€™s about him personal life and how to get in that computer stuff.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the beginning, he didnâ€™t think he is going to invent something new. His purpose is improving Minix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX">[2]</a> . At this point we need to touch upon Minix. Minix is a system which created by Andrew Tanenbaum. He was using this mini operating system for students. Linus thought Minix was insufficient anymore so he was going to developed Minix. Over time the program which Linusâ€™ writing, transformed into a kernel that can run on Unix-style personal computers. Linus developed Linux from 1991 to present. Also last build of Linux is published at 17 August 2015. <a href="https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">[3]</a></blockquote></br>

<h3><center> We are grateful to Linus for free software! </h3></center>
